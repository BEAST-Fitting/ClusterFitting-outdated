README for the Cluster Nut Cracker Code
Bayesian cluster fitting for PHAT

Combined effort of:
Karl Gordon (STScI)
Dan Weisz, Morgan Fouesneau, Julianne Dalcanton (UofWA)
David Hogg (NYU)
Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA)

Running the code requires n-dim FITS files output from the individual
SED fitting code.  The code make_cluster_stellar_prob.pro should also
be run before running the main code fit_cluster_prob.pro.

See the fit_cluster_prob.pro file for how to run the code and an
example.

History:
23 Jul 2012: Added fit_cluster_prob_sparse.pro (KDG)
             First attempt at using sparse memory mapping to improve
             the speed and memory usage of the code

23 Jul 2012: first commit of code (KDG)
             based on work done in Mar at NYU, Jul at MPIA, and 
             at random times at STScI
